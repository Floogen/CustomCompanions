# CustomCompanions
A Stardew Valley mod that allows the creation of custom companions, which can follow the player or be added to maps as creatures.


## Requirements
Custom Companions only requires [SMAPI](https://smapi.io/), which enables support for spawning custom creatures via the map back tile property.

[Json Assets](https://github.com/spacechase0/JsonAssets/blob/master/README.md) is only required **_if_** the content pack being added utilizes rings to add followers.


## Creating a Content Pack
See the wiki for detailed instructions on how to create content pack for Custom Companions.


## Spawning a Custom Companion via Map Tile Property
See this section in the wiki for exact details on how to spawn via a map tile property.


## Example Content Packs
Some example companions are included in this repository, which can be [found here](https://github.com/Floogen/CustomCompanions/tree/main/CustomCompanions/Examples/%5BCC%5D%20Example%20Pack) or [downloaded here](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/users/4112039?tab=user+files).

You're free to use any of the example ring assets in your own content pack, so long as credit is given.
